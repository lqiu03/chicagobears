# 2024 Chicago Bears 4th Down Decision-Making Analysis

This repository analyzes the Chicago Bears' 4th down decision-making strategy during the 2024 NFL season using play-by-play data from the **nfl4th** package. It focuses on how the Bears utilized data-driven recommendations in high-leverage situations to maximize their win probability.

## Libraries Used

The analysis uses the following libraries:

- **`gt`**: For creating summary tables.
- **`tidyverse`**: For data manipulation and visualization.
- **`nfl4th`**: For accessing 4th down play-by-play data.
- **`dplyr`**, **`DescTools`**, **`ggplot2`**, **`scales`**, **`glue`**, **`ggtext`**, **`ggthemes`**: Additional libraries for data manipulation and enhanced visualizations.

## Data

The data includes 4th down plays from 2014 to 2024, filtered specifically for the 2024 Chicago Bears. It is loaded using the **nfl4th** package:

```r
pbp <- nfl4th::load_4th_pbp(2014:2024, fast = TRUE) %>%
  filter(down == 4)
```

## Graphs Included

1. **Go-for-it Decision Curve**: A scatter plot showing the Bears' go-for-it percentage versus the expected win probability boost (`go_boost`), annotated with "should kick" and "should go for it" zones.
   
2. **Decision Breakdown by Recommendation**: A table summarizing the Bears' compliance with data-driven recommendations (e.g., "Definitely go for it," "Probably go for it") and the number of plays in each category.

3. **Worst Kick Decisions**: A table highlighting the Bears' most costly kicking decisions, ranked by win probability loss.

4. **Team Comparison**: A chart comparing the Bears' 4th down decision-making strategy to the Rams and Chargers, visualizing go-for-it percentage trends across different `go_boost` levels.

5. **Go Rate Timeline**: A line chart showing the Bears' improvement in 4th down decision-making from 2022 to 2024 compared to league averages.
